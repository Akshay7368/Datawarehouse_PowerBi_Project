ETL Data Warehouse & Power BI Reporting Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow using MS SQL Server and showcases interactive reporting & dashboards in Power BI.

The objective was to design a Data Warehouse, load raw data through an ETL pipeline, and create meaningful dashboards to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

SQL Server â†’ Data Warehouse design, ETL process (Stored Procedures, Joins, Aggregations).

Power BI â†’ Data cleaning, DAX measures, and dashboard development.

GitHub â†’ Version control & project hosting.

ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow
